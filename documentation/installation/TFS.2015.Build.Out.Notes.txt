Download latest Installation Guide, review for advanced configuration.

*******************************************
Ensure AD Accounts exist for TFSSETUP, TFSSERVICE, TFSREPORTS, WSSSERVICE, SPS Farm Admin account, TFSBUILD, TFSPROXY
(DO NOT do "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" in AD)

Basic server prep:
	Disable UAC
	Disable Indexing service, all drives
	Disable Shutdown Event Tracker (gpedit.msc > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Display Shutdown Event Tracker > Disable )
	Expand Event Viewer > Application and System log size to 100 MB rolling.
	Add custom TFS event filter
	Ensure that weekly defrag is set up.
	Enable file extensions and hidden files in Windows Explorer (Need to develop a PS script to do this)
	Use custom page file size, system memory * 1.5, both min and max size
	Set Power Option to high performance
	
Copy latest Sysinternals Suite > C:\Program Files\Sysinternals
Add C:\Program Files\Sysinternals to %PATH%
	
Make Local Security Policy changes for TFSSERVICE and TFSREPORTS (See TFS installation guide)

Add IIS Role, see TFS Install guide for exact options to enable for the role.
DO NOT DO latest .NET Framework, start with 3.5.1 (or add 4.5 on Server 2012 R2 and above) and start from there.
!!!!!! DO NOT install .NET Framework 4.6.  The SharePoint installer will not function correctly.

!!!!!! Add SSL certificate to all application tier nodes, both as WebHosting AND Personal certificates.

Restart

Ninite.com:  7-zip, Notepad++, WinMerge, WinDirStat

Configure Notepad++:
Install XML Tools Plug-in
Set Notepad++ to default application for .txt, .log, and .xml. (Need to develop a PS script for this)

Copy necessary media to D:\_tfs_data for now, move to D:\Software later ( better AV OAS performance under exclusion folder in policy ).  Installs will take half the time.

First patching with Windows Update:
Set to never check for updates
Use both check boxes to enable Microsoft Update
Check online, not with system administrator.  There are more updates online.
Select all recommended updates.
Select all optional recommended updates (unless .NET 4.6)
Do not install Silverlight, hide the optional update.
Do not install additional language packs.

Restart
Check for Windows Updates again.  I'm serious.  Restart if necessary.

********************************************

SQL 2012 (highest service pack, SP3 here)
	!!! Make sure that the SSRS, SSAS, and SQL are all on the same service pack !!!
	
	Install for SSRS on single AT node (must use Standard Edition)
	SSAS Service fix on DT (Restart the service on crash - Services > Property)
	SSRS Service delay if single tier (Set SSRS service to Delayed Start)
	
	Set up for SSRS report development:
	SSRS:  
	
	Configure explicit permissions for SSRS:
		SSRS Report Manager - IE (run as administrator) > http://tfsdev02/Reports
		SSRS Report Manager > http://tfsdev02/Reports > Site Settings (top right) > Security > USAC\US-ETFS-SQLReportBuilders > System User
		SSRS Report Manager > http://tfsdev02/Reports > Folder Settings
		US-ETFS-Admin > Content Manager, Team Foundation Content Manager
		US-ETFS-DatawarehouseReaders > Browser
		US-ETFS-SQLReportBuilders > Browser, My Reports, Publisher, Report Builder
		USFETFSDEVS > Team Foundation Content Manager
		USFP0001TFS1 > Team Foundation Content Manager
		(Clean out any others)
		
	Verify SQL services - use SSMS for both SQL and SSAS
	
Check for Windows Updates.
Restart

VS 2015.1 Professional install.  Strip out all the features to just leave shell and TFS client assemblies.

DO NOT install any additional VS plug-ins at this point.

VS 2015 addtional updates (if any)
TFS 2015 additonal updates (if any)


Check for Windows Updates.
Take a moment to look through Brian Harry's blog about any recent critical patches.
Restart

Double check SQL client connectivity before configuration of AT.
	* The installer could not make a TCP/IP connection to DT, fell back to Named Pipes for communication
	
Configure application tier (Advanced Configuration)
	TFSSERVICE = USFETFSDEVS
	TFSREPORTS = USFETFSDEVR
	WSSSERVICE = USFETFSDEVSP2
	SPS Farm = USFETFSDEVSP1

Explicitly add TFSSERVICE account to Team Foundation Service Accounts (this is needed for health check application to be able to loopback with TFSSERVICE):
TFSSecurity /g+ "[SERVER]\Team Foundation Service Accounts" n:USFETFSDEVS /server:http://tfsdev01.usac.mmm.com:8080/tfs
	
Install and configure secondary AT nodes.
From TFS Admin Console, reset TFS Notification URL and Web Access URL to point to https://tfsdev.mmm.com/tfs

Move TFS version control cache to D:\_tfs_data (if necessary, should appear in Advanced Configuration)
Set up and configure TFS Health Check application, port 8088.
Set DisableLoopbackCheck = 1 in registry.
	HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa > Add DWORD key > DisableLoopbackCheck > Set to 1
	https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/896861
Edit HOSTS file to include 127.0.0.1 tfsdev.mmm.com (this will make the farm node loopback when calling web services that would normally go through the load balancer)
Restart

Install TFS Health Check web application.
	* Had to recompile the project using the TFS 2015 NuGet package for API support.
	
Adjust TFS access level, set appropriate group membership.

Final polish **********************************************

Pin commonly used applications to taskbar:
	???????????????????????????

IIS maintenance:
	Set all application pools that were created during the installations to never spin down.
	( * most of the application pool idle timeout settings are configured correctly by the installer now, just verify.)
		Application Pools > Advanced Settings:
			Idle Time-out (minutes):  0
			Reycling > Regular Time Internal (minutes):  0
	Relocate IIS Log Files.
	Set up Scheduled Task PS scripts to maintain log files.  Can be found in TFS PowerShell project in $\etfs\Scripts\PowerShell
	

Set up TFS admin report pack.
