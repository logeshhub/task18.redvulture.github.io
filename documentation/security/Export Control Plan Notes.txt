EC Process control group

1st custodian - Everett
2nd custodian - Mike
3rd custodian - who is the DTCM - Divsion Technology Control Manager

SOP:

1.  We determine whether the new Team Project data is actually control data.  Need to contact Trade Compliance.
2.	Everett creates the group, and assign custodians.
	A.	New groups need to be added to the control plan for next year's security review.
3.	Everett = 1, Mike = 2.  Third custodian is the DTCM for the division. (or project owner)
	A.	Third custodian must know the nature of the content.  Loop in Susan Dallas if necessary.
4.	Everett adds the groups to the EC control plan.
5.	Everett sends new groups to Chris.
6.	Chris approves the groups, and adds them to the EC OU.
	A.	Everett emails the new groups to Chris to add to the OU.
	B.	Requires 4 hours to sync.
7.	Going forward, the 3rd custodian adds the users to the EC group.
8.	Everett and Michael ignore the incoming SE group access request.
9.	The 3rd custodian approves the group membership since they are the only ones that actually know what is in the data.


Exceptions:

If there is no Division DTCM:
3M FTE goes through Jo Paluch, verifies in HR that this user is a US resident.
	* Jo has a database that will show you the status of the request
Contingent workers must go to Susan Dalls for the final word on FTC approval.

Action items:
Ask Heather...who, specifically has DBA access to the EC database
Disable reporting.  We could not control cross TPC access with other EC groups.
