*********************************************

Before initial meeting:

ETFS SharePoint site:
	http://tfs.mmm.com
ETFS Team Project request:
	http://tfs.mmm.com/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/Team%20Project%20Requests/NewForm.aspx?Source=http%3A%2F%2Ftfs%2Emmm%2Ecom%2FLists%2FTeam%2520Project%2520Requests%2FAllItems%2Easpx&RootFolder=

Review Team Project request in SharePoint.

*********************************************

Overview:

1.  Basic questions

2.  Cost

3.  Set up

4.  Worksheet

5.  Project creation


Initial meeting with customer:

Have you used ETFS before?  If so, what Team Project?

If not used before, provide a quick 10 min demo if you are comfortable doing it.

Do you have data from another system that needs to be migrated?

Estimated number of users?  What roles?

Who is the actual business contact.  Verify that this is the person that will actually be working with the Team Project.
Need to explain the responsibilites for the business contact:  Security groups, notifications.
It may not be the manager, it may be a lead.  You have to ask.

Which Team Project template?  Explain the differences, but push them towards Scrum.

No SharePoint sites integrated with TFS.  If they want to create a basic SharePoint site via SharePoint Online, they can wire the Team Project to that URL.
Link to request a new SharePoint online site:
Request a Site (RAS)
https://skydrive3m.sharepoint.com/sites/3MAdm/RAS/SitePages/Home.aspx


Discuss cost.

Discuss stakeholder access.

*********************************************

Send user worksheet for details.

Get a list of all the members they need.
	Send spreadsheet (needs rework)
	Add spreadsheet to response folder in $/etfs/onboarding
	
	A.  Name and 3M user pin (A...ZZ, etc.)
	B.	Department number
	C.	Does this user have any retail versions of Visual Studio, Visual Studio subscriptions, or MSDN subscriptions?
	D.	If so, what level of product do they have?  Examples:  Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise vs. Professional, Visual Studio Enterprise vs. Dev Essentials subscription, etc.
	E.  If the user does not have a qualifying product, they will need an Azure account in the EA for the CAL.  We can discuss pricing for them.
	F.	If you have any users that are "sometimes users", like product managers, leadership team, etc.?  We can give them a Stakeholder access level license at no cost, but there is limited functionality.
		Limited functionality for Stakeholder:  https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/connect/work-as-a-stakeholder
	
*********************************************


Add the users to AD groups.

Determine licensing requirements.
Based on the need for stakeholder/basic/enterprise for each user, add them to the AD groups for AccessLevel.
Add necessary users to US-ETFS-AccessLevel-*
(If you add them to nothing, it's basic access)

Create Team Project in TFS.
	Will need to use TFSSETUP account on tfsmigration to create Team Project.

Flip the security permissions to our configuration.
(We need a document explaining how the permissions are maintained)

Go to Notes, add the users to the email distribution list.

Send the business contact the getting started resources email.

Update the SPS list item.

Set up a release folder on \\tfsbuildlab\etfs, if necessary

****************************************************************

Hello,

We are currently in progress on creating your requested Team Project.  We need specific permission/role and licensing information about your team.
Attached you will find a spreadsheet.  Please fill out the Team Members sheet in the workbook, and return to me.

In the licensing column, you will see a value in the drop down for stakeholder access.
This level of access to various features and functionality is limited, but does not require purchasing a TFS client access license.
Stakeholders are generally “fringe users” like directors, department managers, etc. that only need limited visibility and capability in the Team Project.
For more information, please see this:  https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/connect/work-as-a-stakeholder

Once we have the returned spreadsheet, we can finalize your Team Project setup and provide a list of useful links to get you started.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEED EMAIL TEMPLATES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
