1.	Add folder to archive using .7z format. (Right click on desired folder > 7-Zip > Add to archive)  Create a segmented archive using "Split to volumes, bytes".  A good segment size would be 8128 MB.
2.	Use password (provided separately) for the encryption.  Leave all other settings to defaults.
3.	Use FileZilla, connect to 3M FTP server.
4.	Upload segmented archive files to FTP site.
5.	Use FCIV to generate hashes for each of the segment files that you uploaded.  Provide the list of generated checksums to me for verfication.
