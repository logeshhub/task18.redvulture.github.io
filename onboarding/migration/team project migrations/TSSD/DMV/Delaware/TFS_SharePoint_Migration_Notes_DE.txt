DE SharePoint:
Issues with links to other documents within
Can we do relative paths to other documents via hyperlinks

Bamboo?

Plan:
1. Move existing DE MVSS site under /MVSS/DMV/Delaware
2. Manually move documents
	TFS /Documentation > MVSS/DMV/Delaware/Shared Documents
	
3. Everyone will update their bookmarks, DO NOT worry about relative paths
4. Worry about calendars and other list items last.

Timeframe:  Post-Thanksgiving, first week of December?  Will schedule the outage after Dec 3 meeting.

ET Tasks:
Consult corporate support about options for moving complete list artifacts (calendars, Go-Live Tasks, etc.)
