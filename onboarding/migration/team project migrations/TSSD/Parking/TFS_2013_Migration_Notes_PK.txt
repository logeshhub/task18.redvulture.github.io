Firmware
Follow up with the location of the build server.
Chris is not so concerned with the location, just that it meets the requirements.
VM footprint would be small, but needs to be isolated.
Chris is concerned with pulling source from SVN because of history loss and the need to rework their branching strategy in TFS VC.
	Timely Migration would prevent history loss, but branch and merge strategy might need revision.
	
Chris has cron job that runs a bash script for timed deployments.  Told him that it would be easy enough to use Team Build job on a schedule.
Chris is concerned that his migration will not fall in sync with him project release cycle.
Chris is concerned that Arun will force his hand to migrate from SVN to TFS.
