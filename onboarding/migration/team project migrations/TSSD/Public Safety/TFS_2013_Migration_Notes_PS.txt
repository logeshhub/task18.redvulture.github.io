Provide document with migration schedule.
	New connection strings, both for VS and for web access.
	Let Kevin take a look at the web access interface vs. VSO interface.
	
Build server:
	ASP.NET MVC project (+NodeJS) that gets built.
		Elastic build > BOSS Reader build definition
		Not concerned with the other one
	Go to common drop.
	Just zipped up into package, deliver to client.
	
	LPCS and BOSS > code still in SVN
		Both .NET applications
	Server using CruiseControl build
	
	Approach BOSS and LPCS import from SVN / CruiseControl as Phase 2
	
Kevin likes TFS, does not like SVN + CruiseControl.
	Barracuda will start in TFS, makes sense for new development.
	Is ROI make sense for LPCS and BOSS conversion to MSBuild worth it?
	
Build notes:
	Phase 1:  	Re-task vm229 or vm230 as psbld01
				Set up drop location for PS builds
				Build team to work with Kevin to refactor build templates to support on-premise TFS instance
				
	Phase 2:	Research feasibility of using psbld01

Habanero > Replacing BOSS


Migration steps:
01.	Create Team Project
02.	Set permissions.  Include everyone in Contributor.
03.	Clear default iterations
04.	Undo all pending changes
05.	Migrate version control and work items
06.	Remove Everyone from Contributor
07.	Validate results

Migrating:
PBIs, Bugs only > Need shortcut for converting PBIs to Features
Tasks not included, will be left in the archive
Tags?  No warranty.
No areas needed, will shift all to \Archive\
Historical iteration > move all target work items to that iteration (LPCS) (includes PBIs and Bugs)
Area translation:  \\ALPR\PS\LPCS\v 2.7.2 MER-Argentina > \\LPCS\PS\LPCS\v 2.7.2 MER-Argentina > Post-migration > \\LPCS\PS\LPCS\v 2.7.2 MER-Argentina (move area) \\LPCS\Archive\v2.7.2 MER-Argentina
Other work items left behind in archived TPC
Give Kim Cupp access to DMV > Business_Analysis

Initially, leave old TPC online, lock down ALPR
Historical purposes, take PublicSafety TPC offline, inform Kim Cupp

Round 2:
Need another Team Project for Serial

Post-Migration:
ALPR exported work items moved to /LPCS/Archive iteration
Take PS TPC offline, inform Kim Cupp

Action items:
Work items first, Kim is on vacation, and I quote, "They can handle it." - 07/31/15 11:50AM EST
Wednesday - another mtg to review work item results in LPCS_Migration
Hank will return, do another mtg on version control
Bring in Asad (not Abdi yet)
